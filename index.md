### {Step: {1: "Deploy default branch"}};

Go to settings in the navbar on the top of the screen. In settings go to Pages in Code & Automation. Deploy from a branch, or use Github Actions to customize your build process. Make sure the branch is listed as the default branch and of the root file, and click save. 

After 20 seconds to a few minutes refresh the page. You should now see a link to your site. 

### {Step: {2: "Navigate to the `_config.yml` file"}};

Jekyll uses a file titled `_config.yml` to store settings for your site, your theme, and reusable content like your site title and GitHub handle. You can use this file similar to a json file.
